Create code in c# programming language responsible for testing this regular expression: @"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!""#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@\[\]^_`{|}~])([^\s]{40,50})$". Test this cases: too short input, too long input, matching input length, missing uppercase, lowercase, special character, digit, excess whitespace characters in various positions.

Sure, below is a simple console application that tests your regular expression on different cases. The test strings are hardcoded but you can replace them as per your needs. We will use the Regex class and its IsMatch method for this task.

Copy code
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace RegularExpressionTest
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Regular expression
            string pattern = @"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!""#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@\[\]^_`{|}~])([^\s]{40,50})$";
            Regex regex = new Regex(pattern);

            // Test cases
            string[] testCases = new string[]
            {
                "ThisIsTooShort1!",
                "ThisIsWayTooLong1!ThisIsWayTooLong1!ThisIsWayTooLong1!ThisIsWayTooLong1!",
                "ThisIsJustRightLengthWithAllReqChars1!",
                "missinguppercase1!",
                "MISSINGLOWERCASE1!",
                "MissingSpecialCharacter1",
                "Missingsigit!",
                "This has Excess White Spaces 1!",
                " ThisStartsWithWhiteSpace1!",
                "ThisEndsWithWhiteSpace1! "
            };

            // Test the regular expression
            foreach (string test in testCases)
            {
                bool isMatch = regex.IsMatch(test);
                Console.WriteLine($"Input: {test}\nMatch: {isMatch}\n");
            }
        }
    }
}
Please note that for this code to work as expected, make sure your test cases have the appropriate lengths, and that they're missing or contain the elements as described. Also, remember that regular expressions are case sensitive. Ensure that your test cases are constructed properly.
